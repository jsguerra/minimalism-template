# Minimalism Template
This is a simple HTML5 bare bones starter template using ideas from [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and [HTML5 Bones](https://html5bones.com/).

This template is meant to be a starting point with [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as a reset and [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/) as a "typographic starter kit".
